Solve Trainle! 

A way to check how far apart two stations are.

Thanks to [Stevage](https://github.com/stevage/) for creating Trainle. Most of the code for this project is recycled code Stevage wrote for Trainle. This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Stevage (but I hope he likes it!)

## Todo:
- Calculate distance along train track using coords along train line rather than stations (from trainline.geojson)
- Fit everything onto the phone screen (avoid horizontal scrolling)
- Show exact distances?
- Give the hint a nice animation
    - Maybe only show one possible line at a time?
